# Placement Hub

## One stop solution for all placement related needs. We connect college placement cells with the industry.


### This app helps connect college placement cells(recruits) with companies(recruiters). Both parties are required to make accounts and sign-in. Once signed-in, companies can create posts with details about job opportunities and its requirements. They can also filter through colleges and locations that can view their post. College placement cells can view these posts and get notified about various job opportunities. Once a time is agreed upon, both parties can meet online through our inbuilt video call system.
